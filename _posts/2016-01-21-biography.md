I started drawing as a small child at the side of my artist grandmother. We'd take the train from her Brooklyn house to Coney Island Beach, to sketch the sleeping sunbathers. After architecture study (Cornell) and art courses in London, I graduated (BFA) from California College of the Arts.

In London, a friend showed me Arthur Rackham's books and an early 'Alice' illustrated by Tenniel. Working at the time as an architectural draftsperson, I filled the margins of my blueprints with fairy tale sketches.

In Hamburg, Germany, where I lived 1987-97, I began my picture book career with 'Mrs. Peachtree and the 8th Avenue Cat' by Erica Silverman, 'The Blue Hill Meadows' by Cynthia Rylant and a Mrs. Peachtree sequel. Other books include 'The 18 Penny Goose,' 'The Promise Quilt' by Candice Ransom, an adaptation of 'Anne of Green Gables,' and Andrew Clements' Pets to the Rescue nonfiction series. In 2011 'The Christmas Coat: Memories of my Sioux Childhood' by Native American author Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve, drawn from her childhood winter in 1945, won several major awards. This year I completed an abridged edition of 'Les Miserables.'
